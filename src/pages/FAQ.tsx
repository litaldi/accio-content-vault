      question: 'What is Accio and how does it work?',
      answer: 'Accio is an AI-powered knowledge management platform that helps you organize, search, and discover information effortlessly. It uses advanced machine learning to automatically categorize your content, understand context, and provide intelligent search capabilities.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How does the AI organization feature work?',
      answer: 'Our AI analyzes the content you save and automatically categorizes it based on topics, themes, and context. It learns from your usage patterns to become more accurate over time, ensuring your knowledge base stays organized without manual effort.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is my data secure with Accio?',
      answer: 'Yes, security is our top priority. We use bank-level encryption, are SOC 2 compliant, and follow GDPR guidelines. Your data is encrypted both in transit and at rest, and we never share your information with third parties.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use Accio offline?',
      answer: 'Yes, our mobile and desktop apps support offline access to your saved content. Any changes made offline will automatically sync when you reconnect to the internet.'

    {
      question: 'What file types does Accio support?',

    },
    {
      question: 'How does the semantic search work?',
      answer: 'Semantic search allows you to find content by describing what you\'re looking for in natural language, rather than just exact keyword matches. For example, you can search "articles about productivity tips" and find relevant content even if those exact words aren\'t in the title.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I collaborate with team members?',
      answer: 'Yes, our Pro and Enterprise plans include team collaboration features. You can share knowledge bases, set permissions, and work together on organizing information.'

      answer: 'We offer a free plan for individuals, a Pro plan at $9/month for power users, and Enterprise plans starting at $29/month for teams. All plans include a 14-day free trial with full access to features.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I import my existing data?',
      answer: 'Yes, we provide import tools for popular platforms like Evernote, Notion, and OneNote. You can also bulk import files and documents. Our support team can help with large migrations.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a mobile app?',
      answer: 'Yes, we have mobile apps for both iOS and Android that sync seamlessly with your web account. You can save content, search, and access your knowledge base from anywhere.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if I cancel my subscription?',
      answer: 'You can export all your data at any time. If you cancel, you\'ll retain access to your account until the end of your billing period, and your data will be available for download for 90 days after cancellation.'
