          question: 'How do I get started with Accio?',
          answer: 'Getting started is easy! Simply sign up for a free account, install our browser extension, and start saving content. Our onboarding guide will walk you through the key features and help you set up your first collections.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Do I need to install any software?',
          answer: 'Accio works entirely in your browser, so no desktop software installation is required. However, we recommend installing our browser extension for the best experience when saving content from websites.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Can I import my existing bookmarks and notes?',
          answer: 'Yes! We support importing from various sources including browser bookmarks, Evernote, Notion, and many other popular note-taking apps. Use our import wizard in your dashboard to get started.'

        {
          question: 'How does the AI organization work?',
          answer: 'Our AI analyzes the content you save and automatically adds relevant tags, categories, and topics. It learns from your behavior and preferences to improve organization over time. You can always manually adjust or override AI suggestions.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What is semantic search?',
          answer: 'Semantic search understands the meaning and context of your queries, not just exact keyword matches. You can search by describing what you remember ("article about productivity tips for remote workers") and find relevant content even if those exact words aren\'t in the title.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Can I collaborate with my team?',

        },
        {
          question: 'How do smart collections work?',
          answer: 'Smart collections automatically include content based on rules you set. For example, you could create a collection that automatically includes all articles tagged "AI" and "productivity". As you save new matching content, it\'s automatically added to the collection.'

        },
        {
          question: 'Can I cancel my subscription anytime?',
          answer: 'Yes, you can cancel your subscription at any time from your account settings. Your account will remain active until the end of your current billing period, and you\'ll retain access to your data for 30 days after cancellation.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Do you offer refunds?',
          answer: 'We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee for all paid plans. If you\'re not satisfied within the first 30 days, contact support for a full refund.'

          answer: 'We take security seriously. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest using industry-standard AES-256 encryption. We\'re SOC 2 compliant and undergo regular security audits. Your data is stored in secure data centers with multiple backups.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Do you read or analyze my content?',
          answer: 'Our AI processes your content to provide organization and search features, but this is done automatically and securely. Our human team members never access your personal content unless you explicitly request support and grant permission.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Can I export my data?',
          answer: 'Yes, you can export all your data at any time in standard formats (JSON, CSV, HTML). This includes your saved content, tags, collections, and metadata. We believe in data portability and will never lock you in.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Where is my data stored?',
          answer: 'Data is stored in secure cloud infrastructure with primary servers in the US and EU. Enterprise customers can choose their preferred data region. All data centers are ISO 27001 certified and SOC 2 compliant.'

        },
        {
          question: 'Why isn\'t content being saved properly?',
          answer: 'If content isn\'t saving correctly, try refreshing the page and saving again. Some sites with dynamic content may require clicking directly on the article text before saving. If issues persist, our browser extension has a "full page" save option.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How do I contact support?',
          answer: 'You can reach support through the chat widget in the app, email us at support@accio.app, or submit a ticket through your dashboard. Pro and Team customers get priority support with faster response times.'

          question: 'Do you offer training or onboarding?',
