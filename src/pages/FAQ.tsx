          question: "What is Accio and how does it work?",
          answer: "Accio is an AI-powered knowledge management platform that helps you save, organize, and find information effortlessly. Simply save content from anywhere on the web, and our AI automatically categorizes and makes it searchable using natural language."
        },
        {
          question: "How do I get started with Accio?",
          answer: "Getting started is simple! Sign up for a free account, install our browser extension, and start saving your first pieces of content. Our onboarding guide will walk you through the key features in just a few minutes."
        },
        {
          question: "Do I need to install anything to use Accio?",
          answer: "Accio works entirely in your browser, but we highly recommend installing our browser extension for the best experience. The extension allows you to save content with one click from any website."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I import my existing bookmarks and notes?",
          answer: "Yes! Accio supports importing from major browsers, note-taking apps, and bookmark managers. You can import your existing data during setup or anytime from your settings."

      questions: [
        {
          question: "How does the AI organization work?",
          answer: "Our AI analyzes the content you save and automatically categorizes it based on topics, themes, and your personal usage patterns. It creates smart tags and organizes everything into logical collections without any manual effort from you."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I search my content using natural language?",
          answer: "Absolutely! You can search using questions like 'What did I save about machine learning last month?' or 'Show me articles about productivity tips.' Our semantic search understands context and intent, not just keywords."
        },
        {
          question: "How does team collaboration work?",
          answer: "You can share individual items or entire collections with team members, set different permission levels (view, edit, admin), and collaborate in real-time. Teams can build shared knowledge bases and benefit from collective intelligence."
        },
        {
          question: "What types of content can I save with Accio?",

        },
        {
          question: "Who can see my saved content?",
          answer: "Your content is private by default. Only you can see it unless you explicitly choose to share specific items or collections with others. We never access, sell, or share your personal content."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I delete my data completely?",
          answer: "Yes, you have complete control over your data. You can delete individual items, entire collections, or your complete account at any time. When you delete data, it's permanently removed from our systems."
        },
        {
          question: "Do you use my content to train AI models?",
          answer: "No, we never use your personal content to train our AI models. Our AI processes your content only to provide you with organization and search capabilities, and this processing happens securely within your private workspace."
