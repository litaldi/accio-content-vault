# üõ°Ô∏è Security Features Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in the Accio application to protect against common vulnerabilities and ensure user data safety.

## üîí Security Features Implemented

### 1. Input Validation & Sanitization

**Enhanced Email Validation**
- Format validation with RFC-compliant regex
- Length restrictions (5-254 characters)
- Security pattern detection (XSS attempts, multiple @, etc.)
- Automatic sanitization of dangerous characters

**Password Security**
- Minimum 8 characters with complexity requirements
- Strength scoring (0-100)
- Detection of common weak patterns
- Protection against repeated characters and dictionary words

**General Input Sanitization**
- XSS protection through HTML tag removal
- SQL injection prevention
- URL validation with protocol restrictions
- File upload validation with type and size limits

### 2. Authentication Security

**Rate Limiting**
- Login attempts: 5 per minute with 5-minute blocks
- API requests: 100 per minute per user
- Contact forms: 3 submissions per 5 minutes
- Automatic cleanup of expired attempts

**Session Management**
- Secure token storage and refresh
- Proper session cleanup on logout
- Demo account isolation
- OAuth integration with security validation

### 3. CSRF Protection

**Token-based Protection**
- Automatic token generation for forms
- One-time use tokens with 1-hour expiry
- Secure token validation and consumption
- Automatic cleanup of expired tokens

### 4. Error Handling & Security

**Secure Error Boundary**
- Prevents information leakage in error messages
- Sanitized error reporting for monitoring
- Graceful fallback interfaces
- Recurring error detection and handling

**Security Event Logging**
- Comprehensive event tracking
- Sanitized log data (no sensitive information)
- Development vs production logging strategies
- Integration-ready for security monitoring services

### 5. Content Security Policy

**Client-side Security Headers**
- CSP meta tag injection
- XSS protection headers
- Frame-busting protection
- Content type validation

### 6. Page Validation System

**Route Validation**
- Automatic validation of all application routes
- Broken link detection
- Navigation consistency checks
- Performance monitoring

**Accessibility Validation**
- Skip link verification
- Heading structure validation
- Alt text compliance
- Form label verification

## üîß Implementation Details

### Security Utility Functions

```typescript
// Email validation with security
const emailResult = validateEmailSecure(email);
if (!emailResult.isValid) {
  // Handle invalid email with specific error message
}

// Password validation with strength scoring
const passwordResult = validatePasswordSecure(password);
console.log(`Password strength: ${passwordResult.strength}%`);

// Input sanitization
const cleanInput = sanitizeInput(userInput, {
  allowHtml: false,
  maxLength: 1000,
  stripWhitespace: true
});

// Rate limiting
const attempt = authRateLimiter.canAttempt(userIdentifier);
if (!attempt.allowed) {
  // Handle rate limit exceeded
}
```

### CSRF Protection

```typescript
// Generate token for forms
const csrfToken = CSRFManager.generate();

// Validate and consume token
const isValid = CSRFManager.consume(token);
```

### Security Event Logging

```typescript
// Log security events
logSecurityEvent('LOGIN_ATTEMPT', { 
  email: sanitizedEmail,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
});
```

## üö® Security Monitoring

### Events Tracked
- Authentication attempts (success/failure)
- Rate limiting triggers
- Application errors with sanitized data
- Page navigation patterns
- Input validation failures

### Data Sanitization
- Error messages sanitized for production
- Stack traces limited and filtered
- User data anonymized in logs
- Sensitive information excluded from monitoring

## üîÑ Maintenance & Updates

### Regular Security Tasks
1. **Dependency Updates**: Keep all packages updated for security patches
2. **Security Audit**: Regular review of authentication flows
3. **Log Review**: Monitor security event logs for anomalies
4. **Performance Check**: Validate that security measures don't impact UX
5. **Penetration Testing**: Regular security testing of key flows

### Security Incident Response
1. **Detection**: Security event logging alerts
2. **Assessment**: Impact analysis using sanitized logs
3. **Containment**: Rate limiting and account protection
4. **Recovery**: Secure state restoration
5. **Learning**: Update security measures based on incidents

## üîó Integration Points

### Supabase Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Secure API endpoints
- Authentication provider security
- Database access control

### External Services
- OAuth provider security validation
- API key management through secrets
- Third-party integration security

## üìû Security Contacts

For security-related concerns:
1. Review security event logs first
2. Check rate limiting and validation systems
3. Verify authentication state and session management
4. Contact development team with sanitized error IDs

## üéØ Future Enhancements
